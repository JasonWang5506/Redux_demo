reference project: https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-essentials-example-app/tree/master/src

tech file: https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-4-using-data

this project was set up by this repo but was modified as much as I wanted, just to challenge myself and create a redux project just of myself
